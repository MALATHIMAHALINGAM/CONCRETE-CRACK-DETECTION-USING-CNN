# CONCRETE-CRACK-DETECTION-USING-CNN

# Description:

  Building evaluations are performed in order to evaluate the rigidity and tensile durability of the structure. Locating the cracks and analyzing the integrity of the building are significant characteristics of crack detection in building inspection.

# Dataset:

  Images of diverse concrete surfaces, both with and without cracks, can be located in the datasets. For image classification, the visual data are split into two categories: negative (without crack) and positive (with crack). In terms of surface quality and lighting, high resolution images were found to show significant variation. No random rotation, flipping, tilting, or other form of data augmentation is used. The Dataset used is provided below.

# Description of Algorithm Used: 


# Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)


  A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constituted of one or more fully connected layers like in a typical multilayer neural network, which are then followed by one or more convolutional layers (sometimes with a subsampling step). The architecture of a CNN is constructed to benefit from the input image's 2D structure (or other 2D input such as a speech signal). Translation-invariant features are generated as a result of local connections and tied weights, followed by some type of pooling. CNNs also have the advantage of being simpler to train and having a far smaller set of parameters than fully linked networks with the same number of hidden units.
